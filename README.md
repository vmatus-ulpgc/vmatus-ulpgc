- 👋 Hi, I’m Vicente Matus @vmatus-ulpgc from University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain. Currently doing my postdoc as a guest researcher at Instituto de Telecomunições Aveiro, Portugal.
- 👀 I’m interested in research on optical camera communication (OCC), one of the main branches of visible light communications (VLC).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about OCC in outdoor conditions, where the meteorologic phenomena play an important role on the optical wireless channel's quality.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the experimental testing of OCC systems in harsh atmospheric conditions.
